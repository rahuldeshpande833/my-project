#Write a program to calculate the simplest intrest
#where , principle amount (P) = 15000
# Rate of Intrest ( R )= 3%
# And Time ( T ) = 3 Year
# Formula = P * r * T / 100
# Using Python 

p = 15000 # Principle amount
t = 3  # time as time ( tenure of 3 year)
r = 3  # rate of intrest
si= (p*r*t)/100      # SI consider as simple intrest (15000*3*3)/ 100 = value we got 1350
print('Simple Intrest ',si)
